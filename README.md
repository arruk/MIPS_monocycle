code and design by: lucas arruk

a MIPS monocycle processor that suports only the following instructions:
- ADD, ADDI, SUB, AND, ANDI, OR, ORI, NOR, XOR, XORI, SLT, SLTI, BEQ, BNE, LW, SW and J.

the processor was implemented, mostly, with functional verilog code, therefore, all the circuits blocks are, basically, groupings of logic gates and wire connections.
(exceptions include memory elements: instruction, data and register file memories).
